## House Twitter

The goal of this project is to create a "Twitter" style application for myself and my roommates.\
The application will be deployed on a Raspberry Pi 4 and will be accessible over the local network through home internet connection.\
The project is built using the MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express, Angular, Node.js) and running within a Docker container on the Raspberry Pi.\
